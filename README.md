# Alien Invaders in Python 3 (with Pygame)

This program is a tutorial I taught to my Computer Science 2 class to demonstrate classes, modules, refactoring, and to practice several game development techniques.

This tutorial is originally from Eric Matthes' excellent *Python Crash Course* book (see GitHub here:  https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc/tree/master/chapter_12).

- Lesson 1:  Set up game files, create game settings, write the ship class, and import ship.bmp. Refactor code at the end.
- Lesson 2:  Add left and right continuous movement for the ship, boundary checking for the ship. Refactor code again.
- Lesson 3:  Add bullets, limit bullets to three, delete bullets when they leave the screen. Refactor code.
- Lesson 4:  Add alien fleet. Refactor code.
- Lesson 5:  Move alien fleet, add boundary checking, set up bullet-alien collision testing, repopulate fleet when destroyed. Refactor code.
- Lesson 6:  (Missing)
- Lesson 7: Finished project
