# Alien Invaders in Python 3 (with Pygame)

This program is a tutorial I taught to my Computer Science 1 class to demonstrate classes, modules, refactoring, and to practice several game development techniques.

This tutorial is originally from Eric Matthes' excellent *Python Crash Course* book (see GitHub here:  https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc/tree/master/chapter_12).
